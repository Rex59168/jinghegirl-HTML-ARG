  "…我不知道還能做什麼。這個網站我本來是為了找晞晞才架的。\n\n我沒想到最後找到的是姐姐。\n\n三年了,我一直跟她們家說「說不定哪天林昭會自己回來」,現在我不知道要拿什麼臉再去見他們。\n\n晞晞呢?我不敢往下想。這個網站我會留著。\n如果你看到這裡了,謝謝你陪我走完這一段。":
    "…I don't know what else I can do. I built this site to find Xi Xi.\n\nI never expected the one we'd find would be her sister.\n\nFor three years I kept telling her family, \u201cmaybe Lin Zhao will come back on her own someday.\u201d Now I don't know what face I have left to show them.\n\nAnd Xi Xi? I can't bear to think about it. I'll keep this site up.\nIf you've read this far, thank you for staying with me through all of this.",
